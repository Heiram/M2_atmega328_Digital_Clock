# Digital Clock
## Introduction
### At this time most peoples in the whole world use an automated digital clock in their everyday use. Starting from the hand watch we were to those huge street clocks every one of us are dependent on the display the make. In 21th century time being more than money, regarding this change our hobbies of checking our time every minute is dramatically increasing. About 99% of today’s digital clocks are made using microcontrollers which make them more hand able from the rest, those we can set the time to start any minute we want. As the microcontroller consists almost all the logical devices external logic gates doesn’t exist.
### This digital clock marks hours, minutes and seconds, using an ATMEGA328 microcontroller. The clock starts marking time from 00:00, in the moment that it's powered. To adjust time until desired hour and minute you have to use the circuit push buttons in the right side of microcontroller. We have two push buttons, one to increment hours and another one to increment minutes and the time will be displayed using four seven segment LED displays.
